# Model Tuning Project
An experimental area for tuning different open source models for test and learn

## Virtual Environment Setup

1. Make the setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup_venv.sh
```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
./setup_venv.sh
```

3. To deactivate the virtual environment when finished:
```bash
deactivate
```

Note: The virtual environment files will be stored in the `venv` directory. Make sure to add `venv/` to your `.gitignore` if you're using git.
